  io.kubewarden.policy.usage: |
    This policy validates the labels of generic Kubernetes objects.

    The policy rejects all the resources that use one or more labels on the
    deny list. The deny list is provided at runtime via the policy configuration.

    The policy allows users to put constraints on specific labels. The constraints
    are expressed as regular expression and are provided via the policy settings.

    The policy allows users to require specific labels to be part of the resource.
    The list of mandatory labels is provided at runtime via the policy configuration.

    The policy settings look like that:

    ```yaml
    # List of labels that cannot be used
    denied_labels:
    - foo
    - bar

    # List of labels that must be defined
    mandatory_labels:
    - cost-center

    # Labels that are validate with user-defined RegExp
    # Failing to comply with the RegExp resuls in the object
    # being rejected
    constrained_labels:
      priority: "[123]"
      cost-center: "^cc-\\d+$"
    ```

    > **Note well:** the regular expression must be expressed
    > using [Go's syntax](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/).
